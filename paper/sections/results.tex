\subsection{Sepsis Prevalence}

We analyzed a total of 53,417 ICU admissions, from which \textbf{7,261 admissions (13.59\%)} were associated with a sepsis diagnosis based on ICD-9-CM codes. The sepsis definition encompassed patients with any of the following codes: septicemia (038.x), sepsis (995.91), severe sepsis (995.92), or septic shock (785.52).

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sepsis_distribution}, the majority of ICU admissions were not associated with sepsis (46,156 admissions, 86.41\%), nevertheless admissions related to sepsis accounted approximately for one in seven in the cohort.

\subsection{Sepsis Prevalence by Demographics}

To explore demographic patterns, sepsis prevalence was stratified by gender (Figure~\ref{fig:sepsis_gender}) and age group (Figure~\ref{fig:sepsis_age}).

Sepsis prevalence was similar between males and females: 3,179 of 23,323 admissions among females (13.63\%) and 4,082 of 30,094 admissions among males (13.56\%), as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sepsis_gender}. Taking a look into the age, sepsis prevalence increased across age groups, from 8.4\% in patients aged from 16 to 40 years, to 16\%  in patients aged 80 years and older, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sepsis_age}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Mortality Stratification by Sepsis Status}

In-hospital mortality among ICU admissions differed between the patients diagnosed with sepsis (Figures~\ref{fig:mortality_sepsis}) and the patients without a sepsis diagnosis (\ref{fig:mortality_non_sepsis}). Among ICU admissions classified as sepsis, the mortality rate was \textbf{32.57\%}, compared with \textbf{9.05\%} among patients without a sepsis diagnosis. This represents an approximately 3.6-fold increase in mortality proportion in the sepsis group relative to the non-sepsis group.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Logistic Regression Model}

A logistic regression model was developed to predict in-hospital mortality among sepsis patients using the following predictor variables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Age 
    \item Gender 
    \item Ethnicity 
    \item Insurance 
    \item ICD-9 Code 
\end{itemize}

The model was trained on a randomly selected 90\% subset of the sepsis cohort (using \texttt{set.seed(100)} for reproducibility) and tested on the remaining 10\%.

In the fitted model, age was associated with in-hospital mortality ($\beta = 0.00123$, $p = 0.00565$). Several ICD-9-CM subcategories were also associated with mortality, including the codes: 038.3 ($\beta = 0.691$, $p = 0.00394$), 038.8 ($\beta = 0.515$, $p = 0.01048$), 038.9 ($\beta = 0.660$, $p < 0.001$), 785.52 ($\beta = 1.073$, $p < 0.001$), and 995.92 ($\beta = 1.032$, $p < 0.001$). Gender, insurance categories, and ethnicity categories were not statistically significant at the 0.05 level in this model.


\subsection{Model Diagnostics and Assumptions}

\subsubsection{Multicollinearity Assessment (VIF)}

Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were calculated to assess multicollinearity among predictors. VIF values below 5 indicate no concern, values between 5--10 suggest moderate multicollinearity, and values above 10 indicate severe multicollinearity. Our analysis yielded the following results:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for main predictors.}
\label{tab:vif}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Predictor} & \textbf{VIF} \\
\midrule
Age & 1.007 \\
Gender & 1.007 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Both VIF values are very close to 1.0, indicating \textbf{no multicollinearity} between age and gender. This confirms that the coefficient estimates are stable and not inflated due to predictor correlation.

\subsubsection{Independence of Observations}

Logistic regression assumes independence of observations. However, this assumption may be partially violated in our dataset: the same patient (\texttt{subject\_id}) may contribute multiple hospital admissions (\texttt{hadm\_id}), and the same admission may include multiple ICU stays (\texttt{icustay\_id}). This potential correlation between observations is acknowledged as a limitation of the analysis.

\subsection{Test Set Performance}

\subsubsection{Discrimination: ROC Curve and AUC}

We evaluated the model discrimination performance using a ROC analysis. The ROC curve on the test obtained an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of \textbf{0.622}, indicating modest discriminative ability (Figure~\ref{fig:roc_curve}). Using the closest-to-top-left criterion, maximizing sensitivity and specificity, the optimal probability threshold was determined to be \textbf{0.334}. At this threshold, the resulting confusion matrix yielded an overall classification accuracy of \textbf{58.3\%} on the test set.

\subsubsection{Performance Metrics}

Based on the optimized threshold of 0.334, comprehensive performance metrics were calculated on the test set.

\textbf{Confusion Matrix:}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Overall accuracy was 0.583. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.603 and 0.573, respectively. The positive predictive value was 0.406, while the negative predictive value was 0.749. A summary of performance metrics is provided in Table~\ref{tab:test_performance}.
