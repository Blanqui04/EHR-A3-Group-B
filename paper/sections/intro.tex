Sepsis represents a major global health burden, accounting for millions of deaths annually and substantial healthcare costs \cite{sepsis3}. Early identification and accurate epidemiological characterization are critical for improving outcomes and resource allocation in critical care settings. Administrative databases such as the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) offer rich, real-world data to study sepsis incidence and outcomes at scale \cite{mimic}.

While clinical criteria like SOFA or qSOFA are increasingly used in research, ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes remain widely employed in retrospective epidemiological studies due to their availability and standardization across hospital records. However, the validity of ICD-9-based sepsis definitions has been debated, particularly regarding sensitivity and specificity \cite{icd9_sepsis_validity}.

In this study, we aim to: (1) estimate the proportion of adult ICU admissions with a sepsis-related ICD-9-CM code in MIMIC-III, and (2) compare in-hospital mortality between patients with and without such a diagnosis. As a foundational step, we first define and characterize the analytical cohort upon which all subsequent analyses are based.
